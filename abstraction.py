'''Abstraction

Abstract Classes and Methods
Abstraction is used to simplifying complex systems by
focusing on essential features and hiding unnecessary
details.
It is used to define a common interface for different
sub classes.

: A class that contains one or more

abstract methods.

: A method that is defined but not
implemented in the abstract class.
Subclasses must provide the
implementation.

In Python, we use the to define abstract classes
and methods.'''
